# Drone integration simulator

A local integration harness for the drone side of the platform. It uses the shared mission contract and calls the real backend execution endpoints.

From the repository root:

```bash
npm run dev:drone
```

Or build/start directly:

```bash
npm run build --workspace @drone-drive/drone-mock
npm start --workspace @drone-drive/drone-mock
```

Environment:

```text
BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:3000
PORT=3001
```

Endpoints:

- `GET /health`
- `GET /planned-missions`
- `POST /missions/:id/claim`
- `POST /missions/:id/report`

Claims and reports are translated into calls to the backend. The simulator itself keeps no persistent drone state and is only a local development tool.
